#Javascript/Functionalities

1. Need to be sure that all code written in ES6
2. There are a `bug` when you try to add new task which is the date 'createdOn' and 'createdBy'
3. There is an issue in turn the 'checkbox' when you 'checked'.
3. Time formate needs to be more readable.

#Css/Styling

1. It's better the all content of the webpage to be inside the main container which has `margins`.
2. There is unexacting behavior for the 'taskCard' for example: when the description to long, it extend the div width to be for the entire page which is not good behavior.
3. Styling for the new task is missed.
